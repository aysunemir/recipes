Ingredients:
-6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-3 anchovy fillets , from sustainable sources
-1 clove of garlic
-1 fresh red chilli
-2 medium ripe tomatoes
-320 g dried spaghetti
-Parmesan cheese , to serve
TOPPING
-4 tablespoons fine breadcrumbs
-6 sprigs of fresh parsley
-50 g walnut havles
-2 tablespoons pine nuts

Directions:
 1. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the anchovies and allow to melt.
 2. Bash the garlic clove, keeping the skin on. Finely chop the chilli, then add to the pan. Fry for 2 minutes, or until coloured.
 3. Roughly chop and add the tomatoes. Simmer over a low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the sauce is thick. Season with a pinch of black pepper.
 4. To make the topping, toast the breadcrumbs in a dry frying pan, then tip into a food processor.
 5. Roughly chop and add the parsley leaves, then blitz well with the nuts, or chop it all very finely with a knife. Set aside.
 6. Cook the pasta until itâ€™s just al dente.
 7. Drain, reserving 2 to 3 tablespoons of the water, then tip the pasta into the sauce. Toss well to coat, adding a little of the cooking water to loosen it, if needs be.
 8. Serve the pasta in bowls, sprinkled with a generous helping of the topping mixture and a grating of Parmesan.
